Interactive Weather Widget
This project is a simple, interactive weather widget that allows users to input the name of a city and retrieve real-time weather information, including temperature, weather description, and an icon representing the current weather conditions.

Key Features:
City Search Form: The widget includes an HTML form with an input field where users can enter the name of a city, along with a submit button to fetch the weather data.
Dynamic Weather Display: JavaScript is used to fetch weather data from a public API (like OpenWeatherMap) based on the city name provided by the user. The weather information is then dynamically displayed on the page.
Weather Information: The widget displays key data such as the current temperature, weather description (e.g., clear sky, rain), and an appropriate weather icon.
Visually Appealing Design: The widget is styled using CSS to provide a clean, modern, and responsive layout that looks great on any device.
Error Handling: If the user inputs an invalid city name or thereâ€™s an issue fetching data from the API, the widget displays an appropriate error message.
Technologies Used:
HTML: For structuring the weather widget and input form.
CSS: For styling the widget and ensuring a responsive, user-friendly design.
JavaScript: For handling API requests, fetching weather data, and dynamically updating the page with the results.
Weather API: A public weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) is used to retrieve up-to-date weather information for the specified city.
